Changelog

----
0.13
----
* driver using ``InputData`` function must now accept ``**kwargs``

----
0.12
----
* adapt chunksize formula to limit ``multiprocessing`` chunksize between 0 and 16; this resolves occuring ``MemoryError()`` and some performance impediments, closing #82
* GeoTIFF output driver: use ``compress`` (like in rasterio) instead of ``compression`` & raise ``DeprecationWarning`` when latter is used

----
0.11
----
* ``vector.reproject_geometry()`` throws now ``shapely.errors.TopologicalError`` instead of ``RuntimeError`` if reprojected geometry is invalid
* ``vector.reproject_geometry()`` now uses ``fiona.transform.transform_geom()`` internally
* pass on delimiters (zoom levels & process bounds) to drivers ``InputData`` object
* when a tile is specified in ``mapchete execute``, process bounds are clipped to tile bounds
* better estimate ``chunksize`` for multiprocessing in tile processing & preparing inputs
* add nodata argument to ``read_raster_window()`` to fix ``rasterio.vrt.WarpedVRT`` resampling issue

----
0.10
----
* better memory handling by detatching process output data from ``BufferedTile`` objects
* breaking API changes:
  * ``Mapchete.execute()`` returns raw data instead of tile with data attribute
  * ``Mapchete.read()`` returns raw data instead of tile with data attribute
  * ``Mapchete.get_raw_output()`` returns raw data instead of tile with data attribute
  * ``Mapchete.write()`` requires process_tile and data as arguments
  * same valid for all other ``read()`` and ``write()`` functions in drivers & ``MapcheteProcess`` object
  * formats ``is_empty()`` function makes just a basic intersection check but does not actually look into the data anymore
  * formats ``read()`` functions are not generators anymore but follow the rasterio style (2D array when one band index is given, 3D arrays for multiple band indices)
* new ``MapcheteNodataTile`` exception to indicate an empty process output
* raster_file & geotiff Input cache removed
* ``get_segmentize_value()`` function is now public
* use ``rasterio.vrt.WarpedVRT`` class to read raster windows
* source rasters without nodata value or mask are now handled properly (previously a default nodata value of 0 was assumed)

---
0.9
---
* removed GDAL from dependencies by reimplementing ogr ``segmentize()`` using shapely
* use ``cascaded_union()`` instead of ``MultiPolygon`` to determine process area

---
0.8
---
* process file now will accept a simple ``execute(mp)`` function
* current version number is now accessable at ``mapchete.__version`` (#77)
* added ``--version`` flag to command line tools

---
0.7
---
* fixed PNG alpha band handling
* added generic ``MapcheteEmptyInputTile`` exception
* internal: available pyramid types are now loaded dynamically from ``tilematrix``
* closed #25: use HTTP errors instead of generating pink tiles in ``mapchete serve``

---
0.6
---
* ``input_files`` config option now raises a deprecation warning and will be replaced with ``input``
* abstract ``input`` types are now available which is necessary for additional non-file based input drivers such as DB connections
* improved antimeridian handling in ``create_mosaic()`` (#69)
* improved baselevel generation performance (#74)

---
0.5
---
* introduced iterable input data groups
* introduced pytest & test coverage of 92%
* adding Travis CI and coveralls integrations
* automated pypi deploy
* introduced ``mapchete.open()`` and ``batch_process()``
* progress bar on batch process
* proper logging & custom exceptions
* documentation on readthedocs.io

---
0.4
---

* introduced pluggable format drivers (#47)
* ``mapchete formats`` subcommand added; lists available input & output formats
* completely refactored internal module structure
* removed ``self.write()`` function; process outputs now have to be passed on
  via ``return`` (#27)
* ``baselevel`` option now works for both upper and lower zoom levels
* added compression options for GTiff output
* make documentation and docstrings compatible for readthedocs.org

---
0.3
---

* added new overall ``mapchete`` command line tool, which will replace
  ``mapchete_execute``, ``mapchete_serve`` and ``raster2pyramid``
* added ``mapchete create`` subcommand, which creates a dummy process
  (.mapchete & .py files)
* if using an input file from command line, the configuration input_file
  parameter must now be set to 'from_command_line' instead of 'cli'
* input files can now be opened directly using their identifier instead of self.params["input_files"]["identifier"]

---
0.2
---

* fixed installation bug (io_utils module could not be found)
* rasterio's CRS() class now handles CRSes
* fixed tile --> metatile calculations
* fixed vector file read over antimeridian
* rewrote reproject_geometry() function

---
0.1
---

* added vector data read
* added vector output (PostGIS & GeoJSON)
* added NumPy tile output
* added spherical mercator support
* tile with buffers next to antimeridian get full data
* combined output\_ ... parameters to output object in mapchete config files

-----
0.0.2
-----

* renamed ``mapchete_execute.py`` command to ``mapchete_execute``
* renamed ``mapchete_serve.py`` command to ``mapchete_serve``
* added ``raster2pyramid`` command
* added ``--tile`` flag in ``mapchete_execute`` for single tile processing
* added ``--port`` flag in ``mapchete_serve`` to customize port
* added ``clip_array_with_vector`` function for user-defined processes

-----
0.0.1
-----

* basic functionality of mapchete_execute
* parallel processing
* parsing of .mapchete files
* reading and writing of raster data
